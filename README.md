## Hi there, I'm Mahshid ðŸ‘‹
I'm a front-end developer who loves building responsive and high-performance React applications. I've had the chance to develop 10+ user-focused React apps and troubleshoot over 50 websites, solving problems and making things work smoothly. Iâ€™m always learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in front-end development. 
Iâ€™m passionate about creating great user experiences and canâ€™t wait to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a collaborative team!
